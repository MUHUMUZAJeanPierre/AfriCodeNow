Welcome to our educational platform, dedicated to empowering women in tech and young Africans by providing free online courses. Our mission is to bridge the gap in access to education and opportunities. Here's how our platform works:

**Home Page**: Users access our platform's homepage, where they find information about our mission, services, and the professors involved.

**Sign Up and Log In**: Interested users must sign up and log in to gain access to our platform's features and courses. Their credentials are securely stored in our database to facilitate future logins.

**All Courses Page**: Once logged in, users are directed to the "All Courses" page to browse the available courses. These courses are dynamically retrieved from our database.

**Course Details**: Users can click on a course to learn more about it, including the course description, objectives, and any requirements. They can also provide feedback or suggestions about the courses they learn.

**Feedback System:** The user feedback is posted and can be viewed by the admin on the dashboard. This feedback helps us improve our courses and the platform as a whole.

**Admin Dashboard:** The admin, who also acts as a teacher, has exclusive access to the dashboard using the credentials (email: admin@gmail.com, password: 123456789). From the dashboard, the admin can:

**Post** new courses or assignments.
**Update** existing courses to include additional data or materials.
**Delete** courses that are no longer relevant or in demand.
**View feedback** from users regarding the courses.
**Monitor student registrations** and activity on the platform.
Our platform is designed to provide a seamless and inclusive learning experience for all users, focusing on fostering diversity and empowering individuals to pursue careers in technology. Thank you for joining us on this educational journey towards empowerment and opportunity!
